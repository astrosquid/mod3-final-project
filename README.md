# Calendar Backend 

This is the backend API for my [Mod 3 Calendar project](https://github.com/astrosquid/mod3-final-project-frontend) at Flatiron.

Installation is easy!

- make sure you're using Ruby version 2.3.3
  - in the future, we'll be using 2.5.3 for Heroku deployment
- clone this repo
- cd into it and `bundle install`
- setup the database with `rails db:create db:migrate`
- turn on the server with `rails s` (it has to be on port 3000)

Please see the front end repo linked above for more info!
